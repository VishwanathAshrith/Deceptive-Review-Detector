review
"The chair provides remarkable ergonomic support, promoting proper posture during extended hours of work. Its sturdy build and premium materials reflect durability and thoughtful design. Overall, the chair stands out as a reliable and comfortable seating solution, well-suited for professional environments and long-term use."
"Product is good and easy to assemble. But the net seems to be old or used. It has worn out at one place. Don't want to go through the trouble of replacing the whole product for this small defect."
"I purchased the CELLBELL Computer Chair for Work from Home (Grey), but my experience has been very disappointing. The customer service is terrible — calls are never answered and there’s no proper support for product issues. The return policy is also bad making it difficult to resolve problems. I expected much better service for the price. Not recommended. to All Customer"
"would I recommend this chair? NO"
"I am extremely disappointed with this product. The screws provided do not fit correctly, making it impossible to attach the back support to the seat. This is a major design flaw and renders the product unusable for its intended purpose. For the price paid, I expected better quality control and proper fittings. I would not recommend this product unless the manufacturer addresses this issue and provides the correct hardware."
"I strongly advise anyone considering this chair to read this first. My experience has been a complete disaster. The first chair I ordered arrived full of scratches"
