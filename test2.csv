"Perfect everyday watch for office use. Loving the retro design and lightweight feel. Build quality is solid for the price, especially the stainless steel strap. Battery lasts forever (7 years claimed). Only thing is the dial is a bit small and the green LED backlight takes getting used to. Got it for 1700 rupees, total steal!",true
"Bought this Casio last month and honestly it's become my daily driver. The size is just right - not bulky like those huge smartwatches everyone wears now. Fits comfortably under my shirt cuff at work. The metal strap can pinch a bit when you first wear it but loosens up. Classic digital look that doesn't scream for attention.",true
"Really impressed with this A158W model. Super light on the wrist which I appreciate during long work days. The stainless steel finish looks more expensive than it actually is. Simple, reliable, does what a watch should do. Can't complain at this price point.",true
"Got this as a gift for my brother who's into retro stuff. He loves it! Says it reminds him of the 80s digital watches. The build feels sturdy, not like those cheap fashion watches. Water resistance is decent for daily use but wouldn't swim with it. Good value overall.",true
"The watch is good but I wish they made the display slightly bigger. My wrist is about 5.5 inches and it looks a bit small on me. Everything else is great though - the buttons work fine, alarm is loud enough, and the stopwatch function is handy. Durability seems solid so far after 2 months of daily wear.",true
"Classic Casio quality right here. I've owned several Casio watches over the years and they never disappoint. This one's no different. The retro aesthetic is cool without being too flashy. Battery life is legendary with these models. Only minor gripe is the buttons are a bit stiff to press.",true
"Bought it mainly for the nostalgia factor and I'm not disappointed. Takes me back to school days when everyone had these digital watches. The stainless steel strap is comfortable once you adjust it properly. Display is clear even in bright sunlight. The green backlight is dim but works okay. Solid everyday watch.",true
"Very reliable watch from Casio as always. Using it every day to work and it's been about 4 months now without any issues. The finish hasn't faded or scratched yet. Keeps accurate time. The multiple functions like alarm, date, day are useful. Just be careful with the screen as it's not scratch-resistant.",true
"Good watch for the price, simply superb actually. Got it for office use and it serves multiple purposes - timekeeping, stopwatch for my runs, alarm for meetings. Lightweight and doesn't feel heavy even after wearing all day. Comfortable metal strap that doesn't cause any skin irritation. Happy with this purchase.",true
"The A-158WA-1Q has a certain retro charm that looks good with everyday casual wear. Quality is pretty high for this price range. My only issue is the buttons are a little too hard to press, especially the mode button. Otherwise it's a solid watch that gets compliments. The silver finish is nice and understated.",true
"Casio never fails to deliver value for money. This watch is lightweight, durable, and has that classic 80s vibe. Been wearing it for office for the past 3 weeks and it's been perfect. The LED illuminator works decently in the dark. For around 1600-1700 rupees, you really can't go wrong with this one.",true
"I'm a big Casio fan since childhood and this watch lives up to the brand reputation. The stainless steel construction means no worries about rust or color fading. Battery life is insane - they claim 7 years and from my experience with Casio watches, they actually deliver on that. Comfortable for daily wear.",true
"Nice retro digital watch that brings back memories. The size is decent, though could be slightly larger. The strap is adjustable and fits well. Water resistance is okay for washing hands and light splashes. Display shows time, date, and day clearly. Alarm is functional. Good purchase for anyone wanting a simple digital watch.",true
"Excellent build quality for a budget watch. The grey dial looks sophisticated and works well with both casual and semi-formal outfits. It's unisex so works for anyone. The digital display is easy to read. Functions are straightforward to use once you read the manual. Very satisfied with this Casio model.",true
"Really loving this watch! It's become my go-to for everyday wear. Super comfortable, doesn't feel heavy at all. The classic digital design is timeless. Battery should last for years based on Casio's reputation. The stopwatch and alarm features are handy. Only con is the backlight could be brighter, but that's minor.",true
"Got this watch after seeing reviews online and I'm glad I did. The build is solid, the strap feels premium. It's accurate, reliable, and looks good. The size is perfect for my 6-inch wrist.

Durability feels solid and water resistance is okay for daily wear.",true
